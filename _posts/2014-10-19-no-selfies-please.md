I admit I look like crap in 99% of my pictures, but don’t hold that against me.

1. Selfies are tiresome — Getting into the right position, tilting my face at the right angle and modulating my pout is exhausting. Anyone who has spent countless minutes trying to get a halfway decent photo knows this._

1. Selfies are useless — Unless your name is Ellen DeGeneres, it’s unlikely that your selfie will make front page news. The fact is that people will look and stop caring after a few seconds. Is all that effort for a few seconds of attention worth it?

1. Selfies are soulsuckers — Narcissus was a gorgeous Greek hunk who saw his image in a pool and fell truly, utterly, madly in love…with himself. Once you have tasted those likes, it’s easy to get addicted to capturing your image, and lose all sense of perspective.

1. Selfies destroy the moment— That moment we’re living in, that sublime feel of seeing the light float off the waves, tasting a crispy fish fry, hearing your friend’s laughter, smelling the buttery scent of your mother’s carrot halwa. I once witnessed a group of people waste 10 minutes in a restaurant trying to take a selfie, while their food lay steaming on their plates, waiting to be eaten. It’s a bit sad when you think about it.

Note: This is a test post. Big thanks to [Nithin Bekal](http://nithinbekal.com/)  for...well, everything. Like configuring Jekyll,  choosing my theme, giving me suggestions on domain names, teaching me how to work Github and spending nearly 4 hours of blood, sweat and tears on setting this up. I'll buy you lunch.
.......ok, I'll buy you 4.
